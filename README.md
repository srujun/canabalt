Canabalt
========

### A clone of the famous runner by Adam Atomic

The original game is here: [adamatomic.com/canabalt/](http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/ "Canabalt Game")

This is a project by Srujun Gupta/Crypton Labs created for the purpose of learning game creation. All assets and code are free to use and distribute.

To compile the code yourself, make sure you have the libgdx source projects in Eclipse's package explorer. If you want to use the JAR libraries, modify the Build Path and the dependencies as needed.

To fix problems that arise with the libs folder in the Android project, put the compiled `armeabi` binaries into it. Alternatively, you can link it to an existing folder using a linked resource.
